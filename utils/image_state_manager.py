    Manages dynamic image updates based on workflow states as well as
    persisting counters for various workflow statistics.  In addition to
    tracking which Xeno image to display for each workflow state, this
    class now maintains a persistent handshake counter.  Keeping the
    handshake count here centralises state management in one place and
    allows other components (e.g., the eâ€‘ink display and logging
    services) to query or update the counter without duplicating file
    operations.  The handshake counter is stored in a small JSON file
    (`HANDSHAKE_FILE`) so that the number of captured handshakes
    survives across program restarts and even full system reboots.
